# Lesson 1: Introduction to Python

Welcome to the first lesson in Python! In this lesson, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of Python programming, including working with variables, performing basic arithmetic, manipulating strings, and more.

## Objectives:
- Learn how to create and manipulate variables in Python.
- Understand basic arithmetic operations.
- Explore string concatenation and formatting.
- Perform boolean operations and control structures.
- Learn how to print and format output in Python.

## Exercises:
In this lesson, you will complete the following exercises:

1. **Create and Print a Variable**  
   Create a variable `x` and assign it the value `10`. Then, print the value of `x`.

2. **String Concatenation**  
   Create two variables `first_name` and `last_name`, assign them your first and last name, and print your full name by concatenating both variables.

3. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**  
   Create two variables `a = 5` and `b = 3`. Calculate and print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of these two variables.

4. **Swap Two Variables**  
   Create two variables `a = 10` and `b = 20`. Swap their values and print them.

5. **Check if a Number is Even or Odd**  
   Create a variable `number = 7` and check if it is even or odd using the modulus operator. Print the result.

6. **Age Information**  
   Ask the user for their age and print a message with the user's age. For testing purposes, assign the age directly.

7. **String Length**  
   Calculate and print the length of the string "Python Programming".

8. **Boolean Operations**  
   Perform basic boolean operations with two variables `a = True` and `b = False`. Print the results of `a and b`, `a or b`, and `not a`.

9. **Square a Number**  
   Calculate and print the square of a number. For example, given `number_to_square = 4`, print the result of `number_to_square ** 2`.

10. **Formatted String**  
    Create two variables `name = "Alice"` and `age = 30`. Format and print the following message: "Hello, [name], you are [age] years old."

## Instructions:
1. Open the `exercise-01.py` file. Each exercise has a **TODO** section. Complete each section by writing the correct Python code to solve the task.
2. After completing all the exercises, open and run the `test_exercise-01.py` script to check if your solution is correct.
3. If the test passes, your solution is correct! If not, review the output, correct the error, and run the test again.

## How to Test:
To test your solution, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 test_exercise-01.py
