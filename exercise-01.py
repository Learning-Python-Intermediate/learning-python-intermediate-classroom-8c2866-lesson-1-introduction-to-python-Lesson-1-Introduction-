# TODO 1: Create a variable `x` and assign it the value `10`.
# Then, print the value of `x`.

# TODO 2: Create two variables `first_name` and `last_name`, assign them your first and last name.
# Concatenate both variables to print your full name.

# TODO 3: Perform basic arithmetic operations:
#   - Create two variables `a = 5` and `b = 3`.
#   - Calculate and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

# TODO 4: Swap two variables:
#   - Create two variables `a = 10` and `b = 20`.
#   - Swap their values.

# TODO 5: Check if a number is even or odd:
#   - Create a variable `number = 7` and check if it is even or odd using the modulus operator.
#   - Print whether the number is "even" or "odd".

# TODO 6: Ask the user for their age and print a message with the user's age.
# (For testing purposes, just assign a value to the `age` variable directly.)

# TODO 7: Print the length of the string "Python Programming".

# TODO 8: Perform basic boolean operations:
#   - Create two boolean variables `a = True` and `b = False`.
#   - Print the result of `a and b`, `a or b`, and `not a`.

# TODO 9: Calculate the square of a number:
#   - Create a variable `number_to_square = 4` and print its square (i.e., `number_to_square ** 2`).

# TODO 10: Format a string and print it:
#   - Create variables `name = "Alice"` and `age = 30`.
#   - Format and print a message: "Hello, [name], you are [age] years old."
